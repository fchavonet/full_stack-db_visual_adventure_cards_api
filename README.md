# Dragon Ball Visual Adventure Cards API

## Description

The Dragon Ball Visual Adventure Cards API provides structured data on the collectible cards released by Bandai in the 1990s.

It is open-source, free to use, and designed for developers, collectors, and enthusiasts seeking easy access to card metadata.

This API helps you search, filter, and organize cards without having to manually manage data from physical collections.

This API is for educational and non-commercial purposes only.

Dragon Ball and all related characters are trademarks of Akira Toriyama, Bandai, and Toei Animation.

## Objectives

- Provide complete metadata for Dragon Ball Visual Adventure cards.
- Allow developers to re trieve card information programmatically.
- Support collectors in tracking, sorting, and displaying their collections.
- Maintain an open-source resource for the Dragon Ball community.
